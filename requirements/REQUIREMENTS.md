## User Story

- As an event manager, I want to quickly collect information about the schedule of participants,
  so as not to interview everyone personally.

- As an event manager, I want to automatically receive the most suitable time for the event,
  so that I do not manually take into account the conditions from each of the event participants
  and reduce time spent on this process.

- As an event participant, I want to semi-automatically add my busy time from other calendars, so as
  not to manually transfer data from different calendars.

## Job Story

- When I organize an event, I want to get information when they can attend it, so I can reduce time spent on personal communication

- When I agree on a series of events, I want to automatically determine the optimal time, so I can reduce time spent on the thought process and minimize the risk of mistakes

- When I am invited to an event, I want to mark the time when I am busy semi-automatically and conveniently, so I can reduce time spent on non-intellectually clicking
